# Travis-CI-example
A small example about how to use Travis-CI

## the Application

Demo application is **DockerCoins** forked from https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockercoins/ (see: [this folder](https://github.com/theGarageBandOfIT/Travis-CI-example/tree/master/docker-compose%20original%20resources)).

Since it is available as a `Docker Compose` stack, it has been [converted](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/translate-compose-kubernetes/) to be deployed into a `kubernetes` _cluster_ thanks to [kompose](http://kompose.io/).  
To do so, simply apply the following command from the folder where the `docker-compose` file is locatedâ€¦

```sh
$ cd docker-compose\ original\ resources/
$ kompose convert
